# Real-Time Product Trend Analysis & Price Forecasting Platform

platform for analyzing product trends and forecasting prices in real time. The project leverages big data technologies, machine learning models, and cloud infrastructure to deliver actionable insights.

## Overview

This project is designed to provide real-time analysis of product trends and price forecasts by integrating multiple state-of-the-art technologies:
- **Real-Time Data Pipeline:** Utilizes Apache Kafka for streaming data, with storage in Hadoop/HDFS managed through Hive.
- **Big Data Processing:** Employs Apache Spark (PySpark) for processing large datasets and Apache Airflow to manage complex workflows.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Deploys forecasting and sentiment analysis models using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Builds dynamic Tableau dashboards for data visualization.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Manages deployments on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes for scalable infrastructure.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion & Storage:**
  - Real-time data streaming with Apache Kafka.
  - Robust data storage with Hadoop/HDFS and Hive.
- **Data Processing:**
  - High-performance data processing with Apache Spark (PySpark).
  - Workflow orchestration using Apache Airflow.
- **Model Deployment:**
  - Price forecasting and sentiment analysis using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
- **Visualization & Deployment:**
  - Interactive dashboards created with Tableau.
  - Cloud deployment using AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes for a scalable solution.
